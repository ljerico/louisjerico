                Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates etc.</i> </p> </div> <br>

                There are a lot of challenges I encounter during online classes. Like slow internet, slow pc, and home distractions. I am really sad that we are in online class right now, but that does not lower my spirit to learn. As I must continue to learn in-order to have a successful future. Online classes have been mostly good, but there are ways it can improve, such as teachers being understanding about student's day-to-day problems (house problems, slow wifi, and slow pc), supporting struggling students, and giving students much more time to spend some time with their family and friends. Below are pictures that I have of my friends and classmates.</i> </p> </div> <br>
